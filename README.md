# NPPExecScripts #


A collection of scripts to be used with the Notepad++ Exec plugin - NPPExec

## Installation ##

There are 2 methods to install the scripts. The first method overwrites any 
previous scripts created. This is good if it's a fresh installation of 
notepad++. The second method involves appending the contents of the file to 
your current one. This method will retain the previous scripts already in 
place. Use the second method if you wish to keep your current scripts.

### Method 1: ###

Place the `npes_saved.txt` file into `\plugins\Config` of the notepad++
installed directory.

### Method 2: ###

Open this `npes_saved.txt` file, and copy the contents to the end of the 
`npes_saved.txt` file in your `\plugins\Config` of the notepad++ installed 
directory.
